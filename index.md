## Personal information

Currently I'm a research associate at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://math.sysu.edu.cn). I received my PhD from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://math.illinois.edu/). My advisor was [Charles Rezk](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~rezk//). My dissertation defense was on May 5th, 2016.

I completed my BS in mathematics at [Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn).

Here is my ![CV](CV_Huan.pdf).

## Research

My research interests are in algebraic topology, homotopy theory and related field. The main subject I'm working on is quasi-elliptic cohomology.

Here is my [research statement](Huan_RS.pdf).

Here is my [dissertation](Zhen_Thesis.pdf).
