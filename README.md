Personal information

I am a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign working with Charles Rezk. My dissertation defense was on May 5th, 2016.

I completed my BS in mathematics at Peking University.

Here is my CV.
Research

My research interests are in algebraic topology, homotopy theory and related field. The main subject I'm working on is quasi-elliptic cohomology.

Here is my research statement.

Here is a draft of my dissertation. My work is on several topics:

We introduce quasi-elliptic cohomology, construct its complete power operation, and prove the Tate K-theory of symmetric groups modulo a certain transfer ideal classify the finite subgroups of the Tate curve.

We construct an orthogonal G-spectrum weakly representing quasi-elliptic cohomology, which cannot arise from an orthogonal spectrum.

We construct a new global homotopy theory which contains the orthogonal G-spectrum for quasi-elliptic cohomology.
Preprint
